### About myself: 
_I discovered programming while still at school, but I never really got carried away, working with the visual component always attracted me, I taught myself drawing, most likely that's why I chose the frontend._
_Today I firmly decided that I want to professionally engage in web development, the opportunity for such realization of myself was given to me by RS-SCHOOL for which many thanks to her._
